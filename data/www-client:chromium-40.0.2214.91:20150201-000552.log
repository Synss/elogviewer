Some web pages may require additional fonts to display properly.
Try installing some of the following packages if some characters
are not displayed properly:

- media-fonts/droid
- media-fonts/ipamonafont
- media-fonts/ja-ipafonts
- media-fonts/takao-fonts

Depending on your desktop environment, you may need
to install additional packages to get icons on the Downloads page.

For KDE, the required package is kde-base/oxygen-icons.

For other desktop environments, try one of the following:
- x11-themes/gnome-icon-theme
- x11-themes/tango-icon-theme

(Note: Above message is only printed the first time package is
installed. Please look at /usr/share/doc/chromium-40.0.2214.91/README.gentoo*
