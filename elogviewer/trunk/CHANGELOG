CHANGELOG

0.5.1	colors for INFO, LOG, ERROR and WARN
		status bar
		search: just type a few letters in the file list
		update logview immediately upon filter selection
		default sort has found his way back
		a lot of cleaning
0.5.0   completely rewritten with a better object orientation
        clearer and more complete licensing
		minor bugs corrected
		not that many changes from the user's point of view
0.4.1   now uses gtk.UIManager
        added shortcuts
        error redirected to stderr
0.4.0.8 added postrm and prerm phases
0.4.0.7 selects the next file when deleting an elog (instead of the first in the list)
0.4.0.6 fixes decoration bug: the size of the border should now be the same as for other apps.
        no error message on empty elog directory (thanks to maxima)
0.4.0.5 incorporates feedback from nmbrthry
        o Tooltips - I added tooltips to the tool bar
        o Menu - I added a menubar and moved the About button to the help menu (it doesn't really need a toolbar button)
        o Default sort - I really think viewing the most recent elogs should be the default behavior
        o Toolbar class - I renamed this "Actions" so it can generate the menu as well.
0.4.0.4 Bug fix: the prog was probably not working with PORT_LOGDIR unset
        Added a small online help and a few tests in the header for checking missing dependencies (thanks to Yoyo -- Moderator on the French forums)
0.4.0.3 I'll put the parsing of regular logfiles back when it works, now you've got the 99% working elog parser
0.4.0.2 corrects the working directory, working on parsing regular logs as well
0.4.0.1 the elog format has changed and partly broke the filter (that is the current status -- am working on it, it is not that bad)
0.4.0.0 dialog on clear
        adds a filter (show INFO or not, etc.)
        bug tracking
0.3.5 improves reading
        uses sortable table
        adds buttons
<0.3.5 not public
