# An elog viewer for Gentoo

Elogviewer lets you manage [portage logs](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage_log)
in a Qt use interface.  It is written in Python and depends on PyQt6.


## Installation

Elogviewer is in the portage tree

    sudo emerge elogviewer

but checking the repo and the usual

    python setup.py install

should work as well provided PyQt6 is installed.


## Documentation

There is a [man page](./elogviewer.1).


## Contribution

Contributions are welcome.

Bug reports may be submitted on GitHub or [Gentoo's bugzilla](https://bugs.gentoo.org).
